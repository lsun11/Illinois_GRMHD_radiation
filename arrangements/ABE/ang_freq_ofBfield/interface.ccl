#  When you use em_extraction, you need to make sure that the refinement
#  levels crossed by a given extraction radius are ALL updated at the
#  timestep immediately preceeding phi2, phi0 calculation.  I.e., if you 
#  are extracting waves on the N-1th & Nth refinement levels (where 
#  level N=0 is the finest level), you will need to extract waves 
#  every 2^N timesteps, N>=5 AND NO MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THAT.  
#
#  We need 3 timelevels for our gridfunctions, since we need to do 
#  interpolation on those gridfunctions over the extraction radius
#  sphere.  Carpet interpolation does not handle single timelevel
#  gridfunctions properly near refinement boundaries!  You can check
#  this by performing interpolation over a 1 timelevel gridfunction,
#  over a surface that crosses refinement boundaries, and then compare
#  the result to that where the finer refinement level is removed.  If
#  the gridfunction contains derivatives, the former result will not 
#  converge, but the latter one will.
