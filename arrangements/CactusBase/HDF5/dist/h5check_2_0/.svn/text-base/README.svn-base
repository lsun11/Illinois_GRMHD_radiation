README
------
This is V2.0 release of the HDF5 format checker. 

The software is set up to work with the HDF5 File Format 
Specification Version 1.1 and Version 2.0. 

src/  holds h5check library code.
tool/ holds the source code of the h5check tool.
test/ holds the test suite of the h5check tool.
doc/  holds all document related to the tool

========
To build:
========
Assuming gcc, gmake and h5cc are in your $PATH, just do
    % ./configure
    % gmake
    
The default compiler and HDF5 library compiler are set to gcc and h5cc.
If you want to use a different C compiler and/or h5cc command, do
    % make CC=gcc H5CC=$mypath/h5cc

To set different compiler flags use CFLAGS variable, e.g.
     % env CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure
This command will set the compiling to "gcc -O2".
    
============
To run tests:
============
    % gmake check

==========
To install:
==========
To install,
    % gmake install
These go to h5check/{bin,lib} of the built directory by default.  If you want
to install it somewhere else like /usr/software/{bin,lib},
    % gmake prefix=/usr/software install

===================
Platforms tested:
===================
Linux 2.6 (32/64bits), Solaris 10 (32/64bits), FreeBSD 6.3 (32/64bits),
MacOSX 10.6.3
